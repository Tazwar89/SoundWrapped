# Extension Icons

Place icon files here:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images. The SoundWrapped logo would work well.

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using:
- Online tools: https://favicon.io/, https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or use a SoundWrapped logo if you have one

The icons should represent SoundWrapped/SoundCloud tracking.
