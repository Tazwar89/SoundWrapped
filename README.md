# SoundWrapped
SoundWrapped is a personal music insights tool inspired by Spotify Wrapped. It uses SoundCloud's public API to generate yearly playback summaries for users, highlighting their most-played tracks, top artists, and overall listening habits.

## API Usage
I plan to use SoundCloudâ€™s API to:
- Authenticate users with OAuth
- Retrieve user listening data (liked tracks, play counts, artists)
- Process and visualize this data into shareable graphics and charts

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js optional)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **API:** SoundCloud API

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SoundWrapped.git
   ```
