# SoundWrapped
SoundWrapped is a personal music insights tool inspired by Spotify Wrapped. It uses SoundCloud's public API to generate yearly playback summaries for users, highlighting their most-played tracks, top artists, and overall listening habits.

**API Usage:**
I plan to use SoundCloudâ€™s API to:
* Authenticate users with OAuth
* Retrieve user listening data (liked tracks, play counts, artists)
* Process and visualize this data into shareable graphics and charts
